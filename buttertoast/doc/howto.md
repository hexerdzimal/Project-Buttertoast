## How to Hide a TrueCrypt Container using buttertoast

This guide will walk you through the process of hiding a TrueCrypt container inside another file (e.g., a WAV or PNG file). The original file remains functional and usable,
while secretly containing the encrypted container. This method allows you to securely and discreetly store data without raising suspicion.

## Steps to Hide a TrueCrypt Container

### 1. **Select the Host File**
First, you need to choose the file in which the TrueCrypt container will be hidden. This can be any file that you want to use as a "cover," such as a WAV file (audio) or a PNG file (image).
Choose the file you want to use as the "Host." After the process, this file will remain in its original form and can still be used normally without revealing the hidden container.

### 2. **Select the TrueCrypt Container**
Next, you need to choose the TrueCrypt container you want to hide. This is the file containing your encrypted data. Select the corresponding TrueCrypt volume file that you want to embed into the host file.

### 3. **Enter the Password**
To correctly hide the container, you must enter the password used to create the TrueCrypt volume. This password is necessary to modify the header of the container and embed it into the host file.
Note that the password is *not stored*; it is only temporarily used to modify the header and hide the container.

### 4. **Start the Hiding Process**
Once you have selected the host file, the TrueCrypt container, and entered the password, you can initiate the process by clicking on "Execute."
The software will embed the container into the selected file, and the file will remain usable as before. The hidden file can be used just like the original file – whether it’s opening the image or playing the audio file.

Important: The embedded file can still be mounted and opened in TrueCrypt, where the hidden container can be accessed with the password.

### Note:
- **Data Integrity:** No data is lost, corrupted, or shared during this process. The password is only used to modify the container's header and is not stored.
- **File Usability:** After hiding the container, the file remains fully functional. It can continue to be used for its original purpose, while the TrueCrypt container remains hidden from unauthorized access.

## Conclusion
By hiding a TrueCrypt container inside a normal file, you can store data securely and discreetly. This method takes advantage of a regular file's camouflage and allows you to protect your encrypted data from unauthorized access while avoiding suspicion.
